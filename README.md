<p>The "load_repos" project is written in the JavaScript programming language. The main goal of the project is to fetch and display a list of all repositories associated with your GitHub profile.</p>
<p>The project's code uses the GitHub API to obtain information about a user's repositories. For this purpose, the project uses the Fetch API, which is built into the browser and allows sending HTTP requests to different servers.</p>
<p>The features of the project include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using the Fetch API to send requests to the GitHub API and receive JSON responses;</li>
  <li>Using Promise objects to manage asynchronous operations;</li>
  <li>Using DOM manipulations to create and display the list of repositories;</li>
  <li>Using HTML and CSS to style the project's appearance.</li>
</ul>
